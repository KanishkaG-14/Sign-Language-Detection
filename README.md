# Sign Language Detection
ğŸ‘‹ Sign Language Detection Using Deep Learning

Welcome to the Sign Language Detection project â€” a deep learning-based system that recognizes Sign Language gestures in real-time using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and computer vision.

ğŸ“Œ Overview

Sign language is a crucial form of communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. However, due to the lack of widespread understanding of sign language, there exists a significant communication gap. This project aims to bridge that gap by developing an AI-powered system that detects and classifies hand gestures from live video or images and translates them into readable text labels.

The system leverages a custom CNN architecture built with Keras and TensorFlow, trained on a dataset of six fundamental hand gestures. It is capable of both static image classification and real-time video stream detection via webcam using OpenCV.

ğŸ’¡ Key Features

> Real-time hand gesture recognition using webcam
> CNN-based model trained on grayscale gesture images
> Preprocessing and augmentation for improved accuracy
> Output display of classified gesture labels
> Modular code structure for easy experimentationÂ andÂ deployment
